# Black Friday Sale Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing the Black Friday Sale dataset. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into consumer behavior during Black Friday sales.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Preprocessing the dataset.
- Analyzing key features to understand customer demographics and purchasing habits.
- Visualizing trends and relationships within the data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on customer purchases during Black Friday sales, including:
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, city category).
- Product details and purchase amounts.

## Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are utilized:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment.

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Loading the Data**: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Generating summary statistics and identifying key metrics.
4. **Visual Exploration**: Creating charts and graphs to explore relationships between features.
5. **Insights and Observations**: Summarizing key findings and conclusions.

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- Bar charts and pie charts for demographic distribution.
- Histograms to analyze purchase amounts.
- Correlation heatmaps to explore feature relationships.
